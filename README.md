# ‚ú®  Magic Authentication JavaScript SDK

Magic empowers developers to protect their users via an innovative, passwordless authentication flow without the UX compromises that burden traditional OAuth implementations.

## üìñ  Documentation

See the [developer documentation](https://docs.magic.link) to learn how you can master the Magic SDK in a matter of minutes.

## üîó  Installation

Integrating your app with Magic will require our client-side NPM package:

```bash
# Via NPM:
npm install --save magic-auth

# Via Yarn:
yarn add magic-auth
```

Alternatively, you can load via CDN with by adding a script tag to your app‚Äôs `<head>`:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/magic-auth/dist/magic.js"></script>
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è  Quick Start

Sign up or log in to the [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.magic.link) to receive API keys that will allow your application to interact with Magic's authentication APIs.

Then, you can start authenticating users with _just one method!_ Magic works across all modern desktop, mobile Chrome, Safari and Firefox browsers.

```ts
import Magic from 'magic-auth';

const magic = new Magic('YOUR_API_KEY');

await magic.auth.loginWithMagicLink({ email: 'your.email@example.com' });
```

That's all it takes to get started. _Seriously._
